Sudoku

Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a grid (in this case: 9x9 or 4x4 grid) with digits in accordance with certain rules. Puzzles appear partially filled with respect to difficulty and each puzzle only has one solution.

Sudoku rules are as follows:
- Only the digits from 1-9 (or 1-4 for a 4x4 grid) can be used.
- Only one digit can be entered per box.
- Each digit must appear once (and only once) in its row, column, and section.

This program provides a graphical user interface that can be used to play Sudoku. The user may choose between 9x9 and 4x4 puzzles of difficulty easy, medium, or hard from the menu bar. The default is 9x9 medium difficulty since this size of puzzle is traditional. The user may click "Next Puzzle" to access another pre-made puzzle (will ask for confirmation) or "Solve" to check whether or not a solution is correct.
Note: The program will terminate upon the window being closed, and progress/solutions are not saved (they only remain on the page while the given puzzle is in use).
